It aims to provide users with an immersive and enjoyable music listening experience while maintaining the familiar and user-friendly interface of the original application. Our frontend implementation focuses on delivering a seamless, responsive, and visually appealing user interface, enabling users to explore and enjoy their favorite music effortlessly.
User Authentication: Users can sign up or log in using their email addresses or social media accounts. This feature allows them to access their personalized playlists, saved tracks, and recommendations.

Home Page: The home page is the central hub of the application, where users can discover new music, browse through personalized playlists, and view top charts. The home page dynamically updates based on the user's listening history and preferences.

Search and Explore: Our Spotify Clone's frontend allows users to search for their favorite songs, artists, albums, or playlists. The search results are presented in an organized manner, making it easy for users to find what they're looking for quickly.

Music Player: The heart of the application lies in the music player. Users can play, pause, skip tracks, control the volume, and see the progress bar of the currently playing song. They can also view album artwork and access the song's lyrics if available.

Playlist Management: Users can create, edit, and delete their playlists. They can add or remove tracks from their playlists and reorder songs to curate the perfect music collection.
